# This file is used by particlesimSDL to specify the options

# Lines that start with a # is a comment and gets ignored
# Numerical options must be set (ie, not a comment or empty)
# Variable names must be totally different from each other
# ie, one name must be not a part of another.
# Feel free to modify these settings, but beware, the program is fussy
# about the formatting!

# The maximum amount of particles to add each frame
# Ignored if ENABLE_GENERATE_ONCE is set
# (Must be bigger than 1)
# (Must be integer)
# (Changing this value will affect performance)

# The maximum and minimum speed of particles to start with, in pixels per second

# (0 degree is facing up)

# Add particles each frame
# (Enabling this option affects performance)
#ENABLE_AUTO_ADD_PARTICLES

# If enabled, particles will be drawn as circles instead of individual pixels
# Minimum and maximum values specify the diameter of each circle, in pixels
# (Enabling this option affects performance)
ENABLE_CIRCLE_PARTICLES
# If enabled, each circle will be filled. By default they are outlined
# Ignored if ENABLE_CIRCLE_PARTICLES is disabled

ENABLE_CIRCLE_FILLED
# (Must be bigger than zero)
# (Changing these two values will affect performance)

# If enabled, particles will collide with window border

# If enabled, each particle's position will be clamped to

# (Enabling this option affects performance)

# If enabled, particles will collide with each other
